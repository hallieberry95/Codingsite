      <p>Moving to university is the first time most people move away from home. For most of us it will be the first time we have to look after ourselves, but being so busy can often mean that some things get sacrificed - don't let it be your health. Here are some easy exercises you can do in the comfort of your own room to help keep you in shape.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 1<br></h3>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CVaEhXotL7M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        <p><br><br>An easy one to get you started! This can be done anywhere, and when we say anywhere, we mean anywhere! All you need is a little bit of space and a can-do attitude.<br>To start, simply squat facing one way, then jump up and rotate 180 degrees. Ensure that you keep your knees bent when you land to avoid any impact damage.<br> Repeat 10x on each side.<br></p>

        <h3>Exercise 2</h3>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/planks.gif" alt="exercise 2">
        <p>The plank - a classic! Well known and well loved for a reason. Start on the floor almost in a press-up position, but have yours forearms on the floor instead of resting on your hands. <br> Hold for 30s then take a break, that is one rep. <br> If you really want to push yourself, try a side plank (click on the link for more information on how to

        <h3>Exercise 3</h3>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/seizetheday.jpeg" alt="exercise 3">
        <p>Whatever you do - seize the day! Get up and go get 'em! A healthy attitude is just as important as a healthy body.<br>Jump out of bed and start your day.<br> Snoozers are losers. </p>

      <div class="col-xs-6">
        <h3>Exercise 4</h3>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/exercise5.jpeg" alt="exercise 4">
        <p>Lunging - it's about time we got to this one. Another well known exercise and rightly so. Again working on your legs so combining this with those jumping squats is sure to get you feeling the burn. Stand straight with both feet a little bit apart, then step out with one leg so that it makes a right angle, hold this position for 2s. <br> Repeat this on each leg 10x - that is one rep.</p>
